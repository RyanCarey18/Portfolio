# homework-02

I have created a website that has a header with my name and a navigation bar.

The navigation bar links down to each section of the website.

The about section is a picture of me and some text about me.

The "Work" section has three images with links built in.

The Contact me section has a links to me phone,email, and github page, which all take you to a seperate page.

Once the page drops below 900px then the page becomes columned and makes it easier for mobile.
